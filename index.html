    <p> This unnatural overload of wool causes animals to die of heat exhaustion
      during hot months, and the wrinkles also collect urine and moisture.
      Attracted to the moisture, flies lay eggs in the folds of skin, and the
      hatched maggots can eat the sheep alive.

      Does wool harm animals? Wool is a special type of hair that is common to
      sheeps and some other animals, including llamas, alpacas, vicuna, goats
      and rabbits. Obtaining wool harms animals, and sometimes causes injuries
      or illnesses that kill them. Wool is one of many products that is obtained
      through the exploitation of animals.

    <h2>SO WHAT TO USED INSTEAD OF WOOL? </h2>
   <div> <ul>
      <li> <em>Organic Cotton</em> is eco-friendly and natural. It’s not as warm as wool, 
        but you can find nice soft sweaters made from organic cotton.</li>
      <li><em>Hemp </em> a natural, biodegradable material and is often used in blended fabrics.</li>
     <li><em> Woocoa,</em> a plant-based alternative to wool. It’s made from hemp and coconut fibres treated
       with enzymes extracted from the oyster mushroom.</li>
      <li><em> Bamboo </em>is a great option as well. Bamboo is antibacterial, which means you’ll stay fresh
         all day! It’s also an incredibly soft fabric and will keep you warm throughout the cold winter
          months by wicking sweat away from your body.</li>
